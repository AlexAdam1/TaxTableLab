Q. What were my challenges in performing this lab?

A. I would say the biggest challenge for myself in performing this lab was the actual mental processing of the code. It definitely takes some time to look at the code and see the processes that the creator made in the code.
Though it was fairly simple, I am a bit rusty with my java so it took me a bit of time to refigure out the implementation of the getter and setter methods in the program, and to actually apply them to the TaxTableTools object.
